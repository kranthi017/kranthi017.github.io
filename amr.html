									<h2>Localization, Navigation<br>of autonomous robots</h2>
									<p>This project aims at creating an aid to bridge the communication gap that <br>
										is faced by the deaf and mute individuals with the gifted ones on a day to day basis. We had developed a pair of gloves <br>
										mounted with 10 flex sensors detecting the bent of particular joints, forming <br>
										a binary pattern of the input, analysing the pattern, mapping with the alphabets and finally an algorithm to print the alphabets with minimum errors onto a mobile application.

									Starting with an initial plan to develop a simple pair of gloves that convert the sign language of the deaf and mute community, we had gone through understanding the problems and technical differences in sign languages.
									With these problems in mind we had limited our scope to working on specifically the Indian Sign Language (ISL), dictionary of which was recently launched in March 2018.
									Furthermore, after realising the increasing complexity in decoding the gestures with increasing database of signs we had further zeroed our scope to work on the English alphabets in the ISL.
									We had, therefore, developed a pair of gloves mounted with 10 flex sensors detecting the bent of particular joints, forming a binary pattern of the input, analysing the pattern,
									 mapping with the alphabets and finally an algorithm to print the alphabets with minimum errors onto a mobile application. Although the plan was to extend the text to be output as speech
									 limited knowledge of Android development set us back on this extension.<br> <br>
								</p>

								<p>

									 the first step for the project was to form the mapping of the alphabets to the 10 bit pattern formed when forming the respective gesture.
									 The same was made by taking every relaxed joint as a ‘1’ and every bent joint as a ‘0’. Furthermore the detailed analysis of these patterns was essential in developing the algorithms. Particularly, the Hamming Distance
									 between these patterns. This was done with the help of a simple code on matlab to find the differences in the patterns of the alphabets. Using this we had identified the positions
									 on the finger joints which provided maximum distance between different gestures. <br> <br>

									 These locations were then equipped with flex sensors paired with a cmparator circuit which differentiated a relaxed and flexed joint. The threshold of the bend for this detection is varied using a potentiometer.
									 The digital outputs of these circuits is fed into the arduino boards on respective hands which communicated with each other via Bluetooth and processed the data into the alphabet the gesture is mapped to
									 and sent the output via BT again to a smartphone to be displayed. The detailed report and code for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/kranthi017/gesture">here</a>.
