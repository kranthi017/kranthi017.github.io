									<h2>Localization, Navigation of autonomous robots</h2>
									<p>Project competition as part of the course Autonomous mobile robots, we had to develop an algorithm <br>
										to localize the robot, navigate through a half-known environment while figuring out presense of certain walls in the map.<br>
										The path planning was to be done to reach certain waypoints while avoiding going onto certain other waypoints.<br>
										The project (done in a team of three) was tested in a MATLAB simulator since the pandemic <br>
										restricted the lab usage.

								<p>After going through the objectives we split the total project into 3 different parts; Initial position identification and localization throughout,
									path planning, and optional wall detection and integration. For the initial localization, the first approach was to use depth data and use cross
									correlation with the data of the waypoints and find the best fit. However, seeing beacon data is more accurate we focused on using that information.
									And for localization throughout we planned to use EKF with depth data. For path planning, the initial approach was to use RRT but however, midway
									through we had to change it as our RRT was taking too long to plan its path and sometimes, exceeded the time limit. Hence, we changed our focus to use PRM.
									As for the optional wall identification, we planned to compare the depth data at the moment the robot’s view includes the optional wall location.
									Comparing the data with and without the wall, we would detect it’s presence or absence. As for the integration, the three of us split the tasks between us
									and kept in touch at every step asking and replying with the function inputs and outputs for a smooth integration. <br> <br>

									For the project, my part was to localize the robot; initial position and throughout. For the initial localization, I had started off with rotating the robot
									360 degrees and acquiring about 63 readings of depth data with 9 at every 54 degrees. I found similar data at every waypoint on the map and using cross correlation between
									the data I found the best fit. That is, I cyclically shifted the 54 readings and found the error with the waypoint data and found the least error waypoint.
									The orientation was then found by find the number of shifts needed which was linearly related to the angle the robot is away from 0 degrees. However, this approach gave an
									error rate of about ±10 degrees and so, had to look at beacon information. If the robot found a beacon when rotating about its axis it could easily identify its own coordinates
									and the orientation using the x and y shift of the beacon. However, the possibilities of robot viewing a beacon in reality while it is outside its view geometrically or
									having multiple waypoints in a beacon’s view or not having a beacon at all in the robot’s view might pose a problem. And in those cases we rely on using the depth
									information with cross correlation to localize. As for the localization we used Extended Kalman Filter using depth data througout.
