									<h2>Spikehound in Python</h2>
									<p>Spike Hound is a data acquisition, stimulus generation, instrument control and real time analysis package implemented in Matlab and designed for use in physiology research and education. The software allows for connection to a broad range of popular data acquisition hardware from high end, calibrated data acquisition boards to the sound card in the personal computer. This project is going to convert this comprehensive signal-processing package into a Python version. The major goal is to publish the code to enable low cost, electrophysiological data acquisition and analysis to students and researchers at institutions with limited resources. A more detailed project report can be found <a href="https://github.com/kranthi017/Spikehound" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

								<p>The project has various stages as we progress. However, the project scope
								can be divided into three stages. The first task is to complete a layout that is able to receive and print signals like
								oscilloscopes. The next task will work on supportive code, drivers and toolkits from different
								device manufacturers, making the interface compatible to a wide range of devices. The final
								task is going to write functions to implement signal visualization, real-time filter applications,
								audio output to a monitor, and data logging with associated meta-data,etc. Python is a language
								with strong generality which supports almost all kinds of platforms. This project will be able to
								run on different terminals including Mac, Windows and by extension can be used in
								microcontrollers like Raspberry Pi and Arduino.<br></p><p>

								By the end of the project, we could deliver major parts of the requirements before the pandemic hit.
								We first finished the basic functions of an oscilloscope including displaying audio input,
								land input, and input from the ADC converter of USB6001 NI. So far, we can plot any waveform
								from an ADC converter on Windows platform, unfortunately, we cannot solve the problem of
								buffer overflow when we run the same program on macOS. And the current version of NI
								interface software for data acquisition device we used does not support any macOS that is later
								than 10.10v. Hence, using a NI device for data reading is not plausible on macOS. But the
								oscilloscope we built can support any python editor on PC including but not limited to spyder
								and pycharm.<br></p><p>
								The input scale precision can be configured from 1ms to 1s, and voltage level can be
								configured from 10mV to 5V. Trigger level is also adjustable. For the output digital signal we can
								have a precision at around 10ms with respect to the built-in functionâ€™s execution time bottleneck
								in python. We then built three modes in this program to switch from input and output.
								Theoretically, simultaneous input and output is possible but requires multi thread programming,
								and in this scenario, the execution time of each function we used in this program is highly
								unpredictable. This is why we set up three different modes controlled by three buttons in order
								to transform from different input and output scenarios. Apparently, using simple input or output
								mode alone at one time is guaranteed to give the precision we want and applying input and
								output simultaneously is not recommended.<br></p><p>

								In conclusion, we design and test an oscilloscope with python as source code. And this
								oscilloscope can be used and configured with an NI data acquisition device on PC, which is free
								of authorization fee and robust in GUI. Future update and expansion of this oscilloscope can be
								performed by adding more signal processing functions and data saving functions to it.<br></p><p>

								This project was done in a group of three with the others being Chen Ziqi, Wangzekun Gao. Further details and
								code of the project can be found <a href="https://github.com/kranthi017/Spikehound" target="_blank">here</a>.
